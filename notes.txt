# Javascript Truthiness

In Javascript, truthiness is not really that strange or hard to understand.
Most of the typical expectations exist. For example, 1 is truthy, but 0 is not;
null is not truthy, nor is undefined. Pretty straightforward. A couple of things
to watch out for; `[]` - an empty Array - truthy. Whereas `''` - the empty string
is not.

Where do people run into trouble? Comparisons. Javascript has two different comparison
operators: `==` and `===`. The latter is called "strict equals" and it's really
what you should always use.

What about code like this?

  var x = [];
  if ( x == 0 ) {
    print('wtf?');
  }
